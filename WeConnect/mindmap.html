            <strong>Supporting the Digital Enterprise</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Based on the TOGAF Series Guide: Using the TOGAF Standard in the Digital Enterprise. Aligns with the Digital Practitioner Body of Knowledge™ (DPBoK™) Standard.</li>
                <li>DPBoK Contexts (Emergence Model):
                    <ul>
                        <li>Context I: Individual/Founder: Bare minimum requirements of delivering digital value. Key topics: Conception of digital value, digital infrastructure, Agile development/continuous delivery. EA supports by communication, infrastructure description, risk understanding.</li>
                        <li>Context II: Team: Collaborative Product team. Key topics: Product management, work execution management, operations management. EA supports by architecture models, depicting workflows/processes, communication/collaboration efficacy, risk understanding.</li>
                        <li>Context III: Team of Teams: Coordinating across multiple teams. Key topics: Organization/cultural factors, coordination/process mechanisms, investment/portfolio consequences. EA helps resolve cultural issues, depict processes, support portfolio management. Continues to ensure risk is understood and communication is effective.</li>
                        <li>Context IV: Enduring Enterprise: Managing a sustainable business over long periods. Key topics: Governance, risk, security, compliance, information management, architecture/portfolio management. EA expands role into strategy/governance, provides compliance criteria, supports information management, supports portfolio management.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>TOGAF Series Guide: Digital Technology Adoption: A Guide to Readiness Assessment and Roadmap Development.</li>
                <li>Provides Digital Transformation Readiness Assessment (DTRA) technique. Assesses enterprise readiness for digital technology changes.</li>
                <li>Factors Impacting Adoption (Categorized): Foundational, Impact, Sustaining. Examples: Vision, Sponsorship, IT Capability, Culture, Business Model Adaptability, Skills, Technology Maturity, Policy/Regulations, Funding, Governance, Value Realization.</li>
                <li>Roadmap Process:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Step 1: Select the Adoption Approach (e.g., ABCD framework).</li>
                        <li>Step 2: Perform the DTRA (using assessment toolkit).</li>
                        <li>Step 3: Identify Factors Needing Management Attention (analyze output, understand implications of missing factors).</li>
                        <li>Step 4: Address Shortcomings and Initiate Adoption (plug gaps, progressive/Agile approach recommended for lower readiness types).</li>
